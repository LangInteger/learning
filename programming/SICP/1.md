# Chapter 1. Building abstracitons with Procedures

Computional processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers.

## 1 Programming in Lisp

Lisp, whose name is an acronym for LISt Processing.
The dialect of Lisp used in this book is called Scheme.
Lisp descriptions of processes, called proceudres, can themselves be represented and manipulated as Lisp data. The importance of this is that there are powerful program-design techniques that rely on the ability to blur the traditional distinction between `passive` data and `active` processes.
Above and beyond these considerations, programming in Lisp is great fun.

### 1.1 The Elements of Programming

Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing the idea: combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas.

- **primitive expressions**, which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with
- **means of combination**, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
- **means of abstraction**, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units

In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements

- procedures
- data

But they are not so distinct. Informally, data is `stuff` that we want to manipulate, and procedures are descriptions of the rules for manipulating the data. Thus, any powerful programming language should be able to describe primitive data and primitive procedures and should have methods for combining and abstracting procedures and data.

### 1.1.1 Expressions

One kind of primitive expression you might type is a number.

Expressions representing numveras may be conbined with an expression representing a primitive procedure (such as + or *) to form a compound expression, which represents the application of the procedure to those numbers.

```text
compound expression: (+ 1 2)
result: 3
```

The leftmost element in the list is called the operator, and the other elements are called operands. The value of a combination is obrained by applying the procedure specified by the operator to the arguments that are the valus of the operands.

The convention of placing the operator to the left of the operands is known as `prefix notation`, advantage of which is

- it can accommodate procedures that may take an arbitrary number of arguments.

```text
compound expression: (+ 1 2 3 4)
result: 10
```

- it extends in a straightforward way to allow combinations to be nested, that is, to have combinations whose elements are themselves combinations

```text
compound expression: (+ (+ 1 2) (+ 3 4))
result: 10
```

### 1.1.2 Naming and the Environment

A critical aspect of a programming language is the means it provides for using names to refer to computational objects. We say that the name identifies a variable whose value is the object.

```text
(define size 2)
(define add (+ size, 1))
add
```

`Define` is our language's simplest means of abstraction.

### 1.1.3 Evaluating Combinations

In evaluationg combinations, the interpreter is itself following a procedure. To evaluate a combination, do the following

- 1 Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination.
- 2 Apply the procedure that is the value of the leftmost subexpression (the operator) to the arguments that are the values of the other subexpressions (the operands).

This simple rule illustrates some important points about processes in general. 

First, observe that the first step dictates that in order to accomplish the evaluation process for a combination we must first perform the evaluation process on each element of the combination. Thus, the evaluation rule is recursive in nature.

Next, observe that the repeated application of the first step brings us to the point where we need to evaluate, not combinations, but primitive expressions such as numerals, built-in operators, or other names. We take care of the primitive cases by stipulating that

- the values of numerals are the numbers that they name
- the values of built-in operators are the machine instruction sequences that carry out the corresponding operations
- the values of other names are the objects associated with those names in the environment

Notice that the evaluation rule given above does not handle definitions. For instance, evaluating (define x 3) does not apply define to two arguments. Such exceptions to the general evaluation rule are called `special forms`. Each special form has its own evaluation rule. The various kinds of expressions (each with its associated evaluation rule) constitute the syntax of the programming language.
