"""
lambda expressions are expressions that are evaluate to functions

>>> x = 10
>>> square = x * x

This expression evaluates to a number

>>> square = lambda x: x * x

This expression evaluats to a function

Lambda expressions are not particularly common in python, it's more common to use a def statement.
Lambda expression in python cannot contain statements and so they are limited relative to their close cousin - the def statement
