# Chapter 2 Do it, Do it Again, and Agamin, and Again...

## Definition

`lat`

- takes a list as argument, result true if each S-expression in this list is an atom

Definition of lat, recursively

```lisp
(define lat?
  (lambda (l)
    (cond
      ((null? l) #t)
      ((atom? (car l)) (lat? (cdr l)))
      (else #f))))
```

`or`

- asks two questions, one at a time. If the first one is true it stops and answers true. Otherwise it asks the second question and answers with whatever the second question answers.

`member?`

Definition of member, recursively

```lisp
(define member?
  (lambda (a lat)
    (cond
      ((null? lat) #f)
      ((eq? (car lat) a) #t)
      (else (member? a (cdr lat))))))
```

```lisp
(define member?
  (lambda (a lat)
    (cond
      ((null? lat) #f)
      (else (or (eq? (car lat) a)
              (member? a (cdr lat)))))))
```

- `The First Commandment`: Always ask null? as the first question in expressing any function
