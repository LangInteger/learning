Dart versioning philosiphy:

> The Dart community uses semantic versioning1, which helps you know which versions should work. If you know that your package works fine with 1.2.3 of some dependency, then semantic versioning tells you that it should work with any subsequent stable release before 2.0.0. For details on pub’s version system, see the package versioning page.

- [sematic versions](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/versioning#semantic-versions)

> That describes the format of a version number, and the exact API behavioral differences when you increment to a later version number. Pub requires versions to be formatted that way, and to play well with the pub community, your package should follow the semantics it specifies. You should assume that the packages you depend on also follow it. (And if you find out they don’t, let their authors know!)
